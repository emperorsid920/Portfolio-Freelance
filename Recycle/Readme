RecycleWise: Recyclable Material Classification Web App

RecycleWise is a web application that helps users determine whether a material is recyclable or non-recyclable by uploading an image. Using a machine learning model, the app classifies the image and provides recycling tips and additional information to promote sustainable waste management.

Project Overview

Objective
The goal of RecycleWise is to simplify the recycling process by using machine learning to classify materials. Users can upload images of everyday items (e.g., plastic bottles, paper, glass) and get immediate feedback on whether the item is recyclable. The app aims to educate users about proper recycling practices and reduce contamination in recycling streams.

Image Upload: Users can upload images of materials to the app.
Material Classification: The app uses a machine learning model to classify materials as recyclable or non-recyclable.
Recycling Tips: Provides additional information and tips for proper recycling practices based on the classification result.
User Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the classification accuracy to help improve the model.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
